<h1><b>Basic Concepts</b></h1>

<b>How you use the web</b>
<p>
  First, you should check out <em>the internet</em>
  (the world's largest computer network) connection.
  Then, you could communicate with your <em>web browser.</em>
  For example Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc. 
  On the browser, you input <em>a URL</em> we want 
  like Udacity.com on the address bar. Your computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server 
  shows you the right HTML web page you're looking for on your
  browser. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">
  This video</a> dose a good job of explaining.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>
  HTML means <em>HyperText Markup Language.</em>
  HTML is made up of text contents what you see,
  markup what it looks like, references to other documents
  (e.g. images, videos, etc.)
  and links to other pasges.

  video</a> gives you a good overview.
</p>

<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>
  You use a lot of <em>tags</em> for making your webpages. 
  These are very useful for construction and decoration of your webpages
  (e.g. links to other pages, show images, etc.)
  The tag consist of opening tag, contents, and closing tag. You can call the whole
  thing '<em>Element</em>'.

<b>Why computers are stupid</b>
<p>
  They understand your codes literally.
  So they never modify the mistakes what you've made!
  Try to be perfect as best as you can! Bon courage!
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block elements</b>
<p>
  Inline elements deal with your code as an output when they face it while reading.
  Block elements form an 'invisible box' around contents inside of them
